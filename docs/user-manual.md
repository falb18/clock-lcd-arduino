# User manual for the clock

The user manual describes:
- How to change the date and time on the clock
- The functions of each button.

## Buttons

There are two buttons: ***edit*** and ***set***.
The *edit* button allows the user to go into *Edition mode*. Inside this mode, the user loop through each parameter of
the date and time to edit their values.

The *set* button only works when clock is in *Edition mode*. With this button the user can set the value for the
selected parameter.

## Modes

There are two different states or modes for the clock:
- *Display clock mode*: in this mode the clock updates the date and time periodically.
- *Edition mode*: clock enters in this mode when the user presses the *edit* button. Here the user can edit the date,
time and day of the week. Each parameter starts to blink when selected. To **exit** from this mode the user has to loop
through each parameter, by clicking the *edit* button. Only after reaching the last parameter, clock goes back to
*Display clock mode*.
